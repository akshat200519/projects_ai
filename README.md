Beginner level programs that demonstrate the use of AI

The use of TensorFlow for the digit recognition and the basic object recognition is used.
In the programs of digit recognition and object recognition we are using the pre built data sets of the keras datasets
cifar10 for objjects recognition and mnist dataset for the digit recognition
To recognize an object or digit we develop and use a CNNs that majorly focus on the computer vision problems of Machine Learning


For Linear Regression model we have used the sklearn library to import the LinearRegression model and perform the analysis on a basic dataset ie Salary.csv
